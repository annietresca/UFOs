# UFOs

## Project Overview:
The purpose of this project is to examine the presence of UFO sightings throughout the world and provide an easily accessible place for users to access the data. It is intended to allow users to view data on UFO sightings including: Date, City, State, Country, Shape, Duration and additional comments left by eye witnesses.

## Resources:

Software: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Visual Studio Code, Bootstrap

Data Source: UFO data (data.js)



## Results:
To utilize the website, you will need to engage in a search via the Filter Search--- Please note: this is a case sensitive search!

To find a specific result that you know details for and are searching for:

1. First, you'll want to type the desired date you would like to search for in the Date search bar:
![Date](https://github.com/annietresca/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/Date.png)


2. Next, you'll need to type in the desired city in the City search bar:
![City](https://github.com/annietresca/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/City.png)


3. Then, you'll want to enter the state (while this may not seem necessary, there are cities by the same name in different states!):

![Country](https://github.com/annietresca/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/Country.png)


5. Finally, you'll want to search for the shape of the sighting in the Shape search bar. The following is your final result:

## Summary:

This website is a great asset to have when conducting a search of UFO sightings! With that said, one drawback of this webpage stems from the lack of disclaimer that there is no need to press a button to conduct a search-- typing in the bar will suffice. This README is intended to help address that concern and provide instructions for how to interact with the page. One recommendation for further development centers on this challenge. It is recommended that a small checkbox is added that checks off if/when a search has been conducted in this bar. This way, a button is not needed but it does allow the user to know that the search has been successfully completed. A second and final recommendation for further development would be to add any potential photographs that have been taken documenting the sighting. This additional component would allow for further exploration and engagement on a user end.
